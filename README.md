AppleScripts
============

Random quick and dirty AppleScripts that may serve no use to anyone

Combine with FastScripts for easy keyboard shortcuts

== Snap Scripts ==

Mimic the Aerosnap keyboard feature found on  Windows 7/8. In FastScripts I  use:
  
Full Screen: control ⌘  ↑

Left Screen: control ⌘  ←

Right Screen: control ⌘  →
